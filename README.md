(not) a bot that posts "ur mom " + a word, hourly, onto Instagram

I made this as a fun project to run locally on my computer.

### bootstrap.bat
	- launches main.js with the beta timer

### main.js:
	- where the magic happens
	- waits every hour + a random value between 0-600 seconds using "node-schedule", replaces bat.bat (https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule)
	- generates an image (oof.jpg) using "node-canvas" (https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas)
	- logs in & uploads to Instagram using "instagram-web-api" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/instagram-web-api)
	- looks up definitions using the Oxford Dictionary API for the captions (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)
	- verifies proper upload using a "is-online" (https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-online)
	- "-f" to force it to run immediately

### /stuff/words.txt:
	the word list for the images

### /stuff/hashtags.txt:
	hashtags for the captions
	
### /stuff/credentials.json (not included):
	credentials for Instagram account, and Oxford API keys 
	
	- example for credentials.json:
	
	{ 
		"username": "root",
		"password": "toor",
		"dictAPI": "yourapikey (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)",
		"dictID": "yourdictid (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)"
	}
	
### /stuff/.index (will be generated by js.js):
	the index of the next word to be generated
	
### /stuff/.nodelog (will be generated by js.js):
	temporary log file for main.js, will be merged into .log when js.js is finished running

### /stuff/.lastrun (will be generated by js.js):
	the last hour main.js is run
