(not) a bot that posts "ur mom " + a word, hourly, onto Instagram

I made this as a fun project to run locally on my computer.

### bat.bat: 
	- the timer script
	- waits every hour + a random value between 0-600 seconds
	- written in batch to save as much resources as possible when idling
	- error checking (:o)

### js.js:
	- the image generation/posting script
	- generates an image (oof.jpg) using the "Canvas" Node module
	- logs in & uploads to Instagram using "instagram-web-api" (https://www.npmjs.com/package/instagram-web-api)
	- looks up definitions using the Oxford Dictionary API for the captions (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)
	- verifies proper upload using a simple http request and checking the header

### words.txt:
	the word list for the images

### hashtags.txt:
	hashtags for the captions
	
### credentials.json (not included):
	credentials for Instagram account, and Oxford API keys 
	
	- example for credentials.json:
	
	{ 
		"username": "root",
		"password": "toor",
		"dictAPI": "yourapikey (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)",
		"dictID": "yourdictid (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)"
	}

### oof.jpg (will be generated by js.js):
	the generated image that is to be uploaded
	
### cookies.json (will be generated by js.js):
	the cookies for the Instagram login
	
### .index (will be generated by js.js):
	the index of the next word to be generated

### .lastrun (will be generated by bat.bat):
	the last hour js.js is run
