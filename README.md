(not) a bot that posts "ur mom " + a word, hourly, onto Instagram

I made this as a fun project to run locally on my computer.

### bootstrap.bat
	- launches main.js

### main.js:
	- where the magic happens
	- waits every hour + a random value between 0-600 seconds using "node-schedule", replaces bat.bat (https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule)
	- generates an image using "node-canvas" (https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas)
	- logs in & uploads to Instagram using "instagram-private-api" (https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api)
	- looks up definitions using the Oxford Dictionary API for the captions (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)
	- "-f" to force it to run the upload sequence immediately (create next image & upload)

### /stuff/errors.js:
	errors in an effort to make main code more modular

### /stuff/words.txt:
	the word list for the images

### /stuff/hashtags.txt:
	hashtags for the captions

### /stuff/credentials.json (not included):
	credentials for Instagram account, and Oxford API keys

	- example for credentials.json:

	{
		"username": "root",
		"password": "toor",
		"dictAPI": "yourapikey (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)",
		"dictID": "yourdictid (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com)"
	}

### /stuff/.index (will be generated by main.js):
	the index of the last post

### /stuff/.nodelog (will be generated by main.js):
	log file for main.js

### /stuff/.lastrun (will be generated by main.js):
	the last hour the upload sequence was run
